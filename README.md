# Poke3D
Just an simple practice project to create an iOS App that detects the specified Refference image, generates a plane on the detected image and than loads up an 3D pokemon model onto the plane 

# IMAGES 

## AR Plane : 
This is a basic horizontal AR plane generated, in the image you can see how the dice are generated on the plane.

## Plane is generated on the screen or card detected :
The AR plane is now generated on the card detected in the camera. The card is then classified and the correct 3D model is loaded onto the AR plane.

## Two different cards in the camera at the same time :

As the applications of AR is blooming rapidly, the AR industry is expanding and Apple is investing big into AR
this project simply uses the ARKit2 framework introduced by apple in WWDC and uses the image detection and horizontal plane 
to render a 3D model of detected pokemon card on the created plane node
