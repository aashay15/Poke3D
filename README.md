# Poke3D
Just an simple practice project to create an iOS App that detects the specified Refference image, generates a plane on the detected image and than loads up an 3D pokemon model onto the plane 

# IMAGES 

## AR Plane : 
This is a basic horizontal AR plane generated, in the image you can see how the dice are generated on the plane.

## Plane is generated on the screen or card detected :
The AR plane is now generated on the card detected in the camera. The card is then classified and the correct 3D model is loaded onto the AR plane.

## Two different cards in the camera at the same time :
As I don't have the physical copy of the cards, I am using the saved images on two different phones. This also works fine and the expected output is returned. The card gets classified correctly, two seperate AR planes are generated on the different screens and the classified 3D model is loaded on the plane.
